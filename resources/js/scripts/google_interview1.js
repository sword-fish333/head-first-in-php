/*
1. terminate every statement with a semicolon;
2. Use 2-spaces indentation and keep block indent consistent.
3. Respect an 80 column line limit where reasonable, line-wrap long expressions
4. Use named exports (no export default). Keep exported values imutable
5. Fallow naming conventions: UpperCaseNames for classes, lowerCaseName for functions, CONSTANT_CASE for constants
6. Use const/let and avoid var. Prefer "const" when binding is not reassigned
7. Use strict explicit checks - prefer ===/!==
8. Avoid eval, with dynamic code, modifying builtins is disallowed.
9. Keep functions small and focused. Pick clear, explicit and descriptive function names. Extract helper functions to make line wrapping easier.
10. Dont create circular module dependencies. Keep module exports/imports flat and explicit.
11. Be consistent with the surounding code: when unspecified by the guide, match the existing file/project style.
